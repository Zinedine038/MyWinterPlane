How to make 'Object Pickup & Carry System' work with your game.

STEP I: PREPARE YOUR PLAYERS CAMERA

	- At this point you have two options: Do it manually or use a prefab.

	I.1 - PREFAB:
	
	(- Delete the player's current camera)
	- Navigate to the 'Prefabs' folder
	- Chose either 'Camera' or 'Camera_Crosshair' and attach it to your player.
	(- Make it work with your current character controller)
	
	
	I.2 - MANUAL:

	- Navigate to 'Scripts'
	- Apply 'PickupCarry_Camera' to the player's camera
	- Create an empty GameObject (I suggest to make it a child of the camera) and position it to your liking.
	  This will be the target.
	- Drag the target GameObject onto 'Target' in your camera's 'Pickup Carry_Camera' component.


STEP II: CREATE OBJECTS

	- To make a GameObject pickable, you simply have to attach the 'PickupCarry_Object' script to it.
	  BUT BE CAREFUL! In order for everything to work correctly, every pickable object needs a collider!


At this point everything should work fine.
Edit the settings to make everything fit your needs.
